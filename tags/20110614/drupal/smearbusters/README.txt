smearbusters is a project in the Obama'08 campaign that tries to automatically detect smears online, and harnest community power to buster the smears.

I developed 2 parts:
1. a script check.php that automatically checks workflow status, and alter workflow status when certain conditions met.
2. the querystatus.module that display a summary of the workflow.
